            <div class="panel">
                <p class="accordion-p">The plant-based food industry is a rapidly growing market, driven by increasing
                    consumer demand for healthier and more sustainable food options. The industry is characterized by a
                    wide
                    range of products, including meat substitutes, dairy alternatives, and plant-based snacks and
                    beverages.
                    According to market research, the global plant-based food market is expected to reach $74.2 billion
                    by
                    2027, growing at a CAGR of 11.9% from 2020 to 2027.</p>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion">>>Consumer Trends and Preferences</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p class="accordion-p">Consumers are increasingly turning to plant-based foods for a variety of reasons,
                    including health concerns, environmental sustainability, and ethical considerations. Demographic and
                    psychographic trends suggest that younger consumers and those who are health-conscious or
                    environmentally aware are particularly interested in plant-based options. However, affordability and
                    taste remain major considerations for many consumers when choosing plant-based foods.</p>

                    players and new entrants vying for market share. Direct and indirect competitors offer a variety of
                    plant-based products, and each has their own unique selling points. A SWOT analysis can be conducted
                    to
                    identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of key competitors.</p>
